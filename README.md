### So basically I have a playlist that is a complation of all songs in all of my playlists. Before, I had to manually add songs to two playlists when I wanted to save a song - the playlist it belonged to as well as the "Everything" playlist. However, this was annoying so I automated it. Now, running this script will add all songs in other playlists to the "Everything" playlist if the given song is not already in there.
